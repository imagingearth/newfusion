# The New Fusion
## Prepare Input Data
Preparingth input data is a key process before you can run the New Fusion model. The quality of the input data is essential to the model results. You only need to prepare data for your study area and study time period, however a minimun study period of 1 year is recommneded. Even if you are just looking for deforestation that happened in the recent 3 months, it is still better if you prepare the data of the past year so that the model can have a more stable initialization.  

#### Input Data
The input data can be divided into two groups. The required data is required for all fusion process while the optional data is only needed for specific functions. You will be to run a complete fusion change detection process with only the required data. However utilizing the optional data may give you better results.  

Required Data:  
- MODIS Swath Data ([MOD09](http://modis-sr.ltdri.org/guide/MOD09_UserGuide_v1_3.pdf))
- Landsat Synthetic Images (from [CCDC](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425714000248))

Optional Data:  
- MODIS BRDF Product ([MCD43A1](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mcd43a1))
- MODIS Daily Gridded Data ([MOD09GA](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod09ga))

#### MODIS Swath Data
The MODIS Terra/Aqua Surface Reflectance 5-minute L2 Swath Data (MOD09) provides MODIS surface reflectance for bands 1 and 2 (at 250m), bands 1 – 7 (at 500 m) and bands 1 – 16 (at 1 km resolution), multiresolution QA, and 1 km observation statistics. The swath data, different from regular gridded product,
