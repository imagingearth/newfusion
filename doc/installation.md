# The New Fusion
## Installation
The core of the New Fusion program is writen in [MATLAB](http://matlab.com) and works with just MATLAB alone. Part of the BRDF correction process is writen in [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and uses [gdal](https://http://gdal.org/). And [hdf](https://hdfeos.org/) support is needed if output of predicted MODIS swath in HDF format is needed. Also some stand-along tools are writen in [R](https://r-project.org/). 90% of the functions, especially the core functions, of the New Fusion model can be performed in MATLAB. Most users should have no problem using the New Fusion just in MATLAB.
